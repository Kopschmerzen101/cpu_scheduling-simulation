# cpu_scheduling-simulation
This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms to demonstrate how processes are managed in an operating system. The simulation includes popular scheduling techniques such as:First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Shortest Job Next (SJN) Round Robin (RR) Priority Scheduling
